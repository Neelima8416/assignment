Q4.CREATE AN S3 BUCKET AND DEPLOY THE REACTJS STATIC
APPLICATION ON IT

->Firstly, clone the Reactjs static application folder.
->Now, create a bucket and the bucket name should be a valid one.
->Now, as the folder is an application, it can be uploaded into a s3
bucket for static website hosting directly.
->So, we need to create a build folder by using the command “npm run
build”.
->Before using this command, make sure that our system has a nodejs
application.
->If the local system does not have nodejs application, then download it
and then install the nodejs application.
->Now, go to command prompt via react application folder.
->Enter “code .” it will lead you to vs code.
->Now, open the terminal and run the following commands:
  *npm i
  *npm run build
->Then, the build folder will be created.
->Now, upload all the files and folders which are present in the build
folder into s3 bucket(acbu).
->Now, enable ACLs, and make all the objects as public.
->Then, go to properties of bucket and enable static website hosting and
enter index.html over there.
->Now, copy the static website URL and open in another tab.
